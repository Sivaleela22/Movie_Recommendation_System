# Movie_Recommendation_System
This repository contains a simple, interactive movie recommendation system built using Streamlit. The application suggests movies to users based on their selection, leveraging a pre-calculated similarity matrix.

About the Project
This project aims to provide users with personalized movie recommendations. By selecting a movie from a dropdown list, the system identifies and displays five other movies that are most similar based on their content (e.g., genre, cast, director, keywords). The core of the recommendation logic relies on a cosine similarity matrix generated from movie data.

Features
Interactive User Interface: Built with Streamlit for a clean and easy-to-use web interface.

Movie Selection: Users can select any movie from a comprehensive list.

Top 5 Recommendations: Displays the top 5 most similar movies based on the user's choice.

Movie Poster Display: (Optional, requires TMDb API Key) Shows posters for recommended movies.

Robust Error Handling: Includes basic error handling for data loading and API calls.

Technologies Used
Python

Streamlit: For building the web application.

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: (Implicitly, for similarity calculation in the notebook)

Requests: For making API calls to fetch movie posters.

The Movie Database (TMDb) API: External API for movie metadata and posters.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.7+

pip (Python package installer)

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-movie-recommendation-repo.git
cd your-movie-recommendation-repo

(Replace your-username/your-movie-recommendation-repo.git with your actual GitHub repository URL)

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn requests

4. Prepare Data Files
This project requires two pre-processed data files: movie_data.csv and similarity.pkl. These files are typically generated by a data processing script (like a Jupyter Notebook, e.g., movie_recommendation.ipynb).

Generate the files: Run your movie_recommendation.ipynb notebook to ensure movie_data.csv and similarity.pkl are created.

Place the files: Create a folder named model in the root directory of your project, and place movie_data.csv and similarity.pkl inside it.

Your project structure should look like this:

your-movie-recommendation-repo/
├── app.py
├── movie_recommendation.ipynb (optional, your notebook for data generation)
├── venv/                      (your virtual environment)
└── model/
    ├── movie_data.csv
    └── similarity.pkl

Running the Application
Once the setup is complete, you can run the Streamlit application:

Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):

# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

Navigate to the project root directory (where app.py is located).

Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

Your web browser will automatically open a new tab displaying the application (usually at http://localhost:8501).

Important Note on Movie Posters (API Key)
The application attempts to fetch movie posters from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. During development, you might encounter ConnectionError due to network restrictions, firewalls, or an incorrect API key.

Obtain a TMDb API Key:

Go to themoviedb.org and sign up for an account.

Navigate to your Account Settings -> API and request a v3 API key.

Copy your API key.

Insert API Key into app.py:
Open app.py and replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual TMDb API key:

TMDb_API_KEY = "your_actual_tmdb_v3_api_key_here"

Bypass Poster Fetching (Troubleshooting):
If you continue to face ConnectionError for posters, you can temporarily disable the API calls to ensure the rest of the app functions. Set the BYPASS_POSTER_FETCHING flag to True in app.py:

BYPASS_POSTER_FETCHING = True

When True, the app will display placeholder images instead of trying to fetch real posters.

Future Enhancements
Implement a search bar for movies instead of just a dropdown.

Add more detailed movie information (e.g., genre, release date, rating) to recommendations.

Explore different recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering).

Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Streamlit Cloud) for public access.

Improve UI/UX with more advanced Streamlit features or custom CSS.
